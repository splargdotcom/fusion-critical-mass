Fusion

There is no optimal strategy.

Fusion is a falling-block system in which blocks do not clear.
They combine.

As blocks connect, mass accumulates.
As mass accumulates, instability increases.
At sufficient density, energy is released.

The system continues.

Overview

Fusion explores accumulation rather than removal.

Unlike traditional falling-block games, completed structures are not rewarded with disappearance. Connected blocks persist, forming increasingly large contiguous masses. Instability is calculated from the size of the largest connected structure.

When a critical threshold is reached, an energy release occurs. This is not treated as a failure state. Play resumes under altered conditions.

Core Mechanics

Blocks fall into a fixed-width grid

Adjacent blocks fuse instead of clearing

Gravity resolves gaps after placement

The largest connected structure determines instability

Critical mass triggers an energy release

The board resets and play continues

There is no win condition.

Measurement

The system records:

Total mass accumulated

Energy released

Duration of delay

Survival is not evaluated.

Session Awareness

Fusion recognises repetition within a single session.

Based on observed outcomes, it may:

Adjust pacing slightly

Alter its narration

Acknowledge prior events

No data is stored permanently.
Nothing persists beyond the session.

Controls

Left / Right Arrow — Move

Down Arrow — Accelerate descent

Up Arrow / Space — Rotate

Audio begins on user interaction.

Design Notes

Mechanics are deterministic but outcomes are not optimisable

Escalation is bounded, not punitive

The system does not express judgement

Explanation is intentionally limited

Silence is used as feedback.

Technology

Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Canvas rendering

Web Audio API

No external libraries

No persistence or analytics

Status

Complete.

Further development would risk over-definition.
